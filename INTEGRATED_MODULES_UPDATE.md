# 90-Day Action Plan - Integrated Health Modules Update

## Summary of Changes

The 90-Day Action Plan has been updated to include four new integrated health management modules alongside the core HIV management system:

### New Integrated Modules

#### 1. **Chronic Disease Management Module**
- Diabetes and hypertension patient tracking
- Medication monitoring for chronic conditions
- Vital signs integration (blood pressure, glucose levels)
- Comorbidity risk alerts and escalation
- Clinic visit scheduling based on condition status

**Revenue Potential:** Additional UGX 370,000-740,000/month per facility

#### 2. **Maternal Health Tracking Module**
- PMTCT (Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission) monitoring
- Antenatal care scheduling and follow-ups
- Postnatal follow-up tracking
- Infant prophylaxis adherence monitoring
- Care coordinator alerts for high-risk pregnancies

**Value Proposition:** Reduces maternal-to-child HIV transmission through automated tracking and alerts

#### 3. **Medication Adherence System**
- AI-powered medication reminders via WhatsApp
- Adherence pattern analysis and trend detection
- Early warning system for non-adherence
- Family/caregiver engagement tools
- Personalized intervention recommendations

**Impact:** Improves medication adherence across all therapies (ART, diabetes, hypertension, TB)

#### 4. **Clinic Appointment Management Module**
- Automated appointment scheduling
- Multi-day reminder system (via WhatsApp)
- No-show prediction using historical data
- Automatic appointment rescheduling workflow
- Clinic resource optimization and capacity planning

**Impact:** Reduces no-show rates by 25-30%, improves clinic efficiency

### Updated Value Proposition

**Previous:** Saves 8-10 hours monthly per facility
**Updated:** Saves 12-15 hours monthly per facility through integrated module automation

### Key Document Updates

1. **Executive Summary**
   - Added comprehensive health coverage as key differentiator
   - Updated time savings from 8-10 to 12-15 hours monthly
   - Added module upsell revenue potential

2. **Problem Statement**
   - Expanded from HIV-only focus to integrated comorbidity management
   - Now addresses medication adherence, maternal health, and appointment management
   - Quantified administrative burden at 15+ hours per week

3. **Competitive Advantage**
   - Added "Comprehensive Health Coverage" as standalone advantage
   - Highlighted integrated platform vs. single-purpose tools
   - Positioned as cost-effective alternative to buying 4-5 separate systems

4. **Technical Setup (Week 1-2)**
   - Added module development as key deliverable
   - Expanded Google Sheets templates to cover all modules
   - Updated integration requirements for multi-module system

5. **Marketing & Content Strategy**
   - Emphasize time-savings across multiple health conditions
   - Highlight clinical outcome improvements (adherence, appointment attendance)
   - Case studies now showcase integration benefits

6. **Customer Conversion & Growth**
   - Updated deliverables to reflect multi-module platform
   - Added module upsell strategy for existing customers
   - Expanded outreach messaging to include maternal health and chronic disease angles

### Revenue Impact

**Tier Enhancement:**
- Silver tier remains at UGX 2,956,300/month (core HIV + integrated modules)
- Module upsells: UGX 370,000-740,000/month per additional module

**Example Customer Scenarios:**
- Small clinic (Bronze + Maternal Health): UGX 1,846,300/month
- District program (Silver + Chronic Disease + Maternal): UGX 3,696,300/month
- Multi-facility network (Gold + all modules): UGX 6,996,300/month

### 90-Day Milestone Updates

- **Days 1-30:** Build and test all integrated modules with real data
- **Days 31-60:** Pilot integrated platform with 3-5 customers, gather cross-module feedback
- **Days 61-90:** Convert pilots to paid subscriptions with module upsells

### Market Positioning

**Competitive Set:**
- Replaces 4-5 separate single-purpose tools with one integrated platform
- OpenMRS + external diabetes management + separate maternal health system = $1,000+/month
- Our solution = UGX 2,956,300/month ($800) with full integration

### Next Steps

1. Update prospect outreach messaging to emphasize comorbidity management
2. Develop demo videos showing module workflows
3. Create implementation guides for each module
4. Research and validate demand for modules (especially maternal health and chronic disease in target region)
5. Plan Phase 2 revenue model with module-based pricing tiers
